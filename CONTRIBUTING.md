# Contributing to Gunship

Hello fellow Rustacean and thank you for showing interest in Gunship! Before you go any further there's a few things you should know:

- Gunship is in a *very* early stage of development. As such your contributions add a lot but it's also going to be more difficult to make those contributions due to the incomplete state of much of the code.
- Gunship is meant to be an experimental engine used as a learning excercise for those who develop it. Of course the best way to learn about game engines is to make one that is high enough quality to be used in the wild so my goal in developing Gunship is to do just that. But being an learning project means that I often make impractical choices for Gunship's development in the name of gaining more experience rather than quickly building a production-ready product. For the forseeable future this will be the case so if you're looking to add new functionality be prepared to have to build a lot of it from scratch.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is with one of the [`difficulty: easy (hours)`](https://github.com/excaliburHisSheath/gunship-rs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22difficulty%3A+easy+%28hours%29%22). All Gunship tasks are mentored but those are especially quick to get up-and-running with and require the least knowlege of Rust or the engine. Easy tasks are also (usually) well defined and require little investigation (beyond familiarizing oneself with Rust/Gunship).

## Contributions

Gunship welcomes contributions from everyone. All contributions should be made in the form of a GitHub pull request. Pull requests will be reviewed by core members and merged once they have been approved.
